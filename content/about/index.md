## About Me
Hello, my name is Donut, a girl in her early 20s who loves sweets and is a graduate student. My anime-style self-portrait is on the right, and you can add me on QQ for more details. (Since I'm also an anime fan and have a shy personality, I've turned my self-portrait into this format.)
## Content Summary
This is my first time writing a blog in this format, and I'm not quite sure what to write about, so I'll just document my daily life and academic experiences! (Of course, there will be more trivial matters of daily life, after all, my studies aren't going well, and my mentor is far away from us... I won't complain about my mentor here, as it might dampen everyone's spirits. For those who want to know more details or avoid certain mentors, friends can click here: My Troubles)
## Purpose of the website
### Give a thumbs up for the beautiful scenery
I come from a small city in the western part of China — Chengdu. From the age of 0 to 18, I grew up in this city, thriving alongside it. From 18 to 22, I left my hometown and went to Ya'an City in Sichuan Province, the birthplace of the giant panda, to study alone. Since turning 22, I have moved to the 8D magical city of Chongqing to continue my solitary academic journey. In these unfamiliar new cities, I often feel small, helpless, and lost, and with my shy, timid, and introverted personality, I fear that others may not accept me, so I don't know to whom I can confide my troubles. However, when I step out and spend all my spare time hiking and traveling; when I escape the fast-paced, oppressive life and witness the grandeur of nature; I find that the beauty of nature can dilute my worries; nature treats every life equally, without distinction of status or rank. I want to share the beautiful scenes and things I've seen here, to remind my lonely self that no matter where I am, nature is always by your side, accompanying you through the difficulties and the dark nights!
### Give a thumbs up for the delicious food
Food is the foremost necessity of the people! Delectable cuisine plays a multifaceted and significant role in human life; it's not only a means to satisfy basic physiological needs but also an expression of culture and emotion. As I explore unfamiliar cities, I make sure not to miss out on all the authentic local delicacies! (After all, I'll be living there for several years! There's plenty of time!)

Then, I'd like to share with my friends why I love sweets. They remind me of the sweet memories of my childhood; they can be quickly absorbed by the body, enter the bloodstream, and stimulate the brain to release dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward; indulging in sweets may also prompt the brain to release endorphins, a natural analgesic that can produce relaxation and happiness; finally, the brain's reward system is easily activated by high-calorie sweets, generating a sense of pleasure. (It's time for some not-so-fun science.)

In the days away from home, I've become especially cherishing of every little gathering in life, because many small blessings start with unexpected little meals, and there's not much joy that a helpless wanderer can accumulate; I've also become particularly grateful for every dish my parents cooked for me, which contains memories of my hometown and childhood. I finally understand that there's no one in the world who loves me as much as they do, and I realize they are gradually growing old... I've also started learning to cook their favorite dishes or buy what they love to eat, to share together... Capturing every small blessing in life with a camera serves as a reminder to myself that life is always full of beauty, please cherish it!
### Let the beautiful moments be remembered
Looking back, if judged by money and achievements, I am just an ordinary person, with no significant accomplishments or memorable feasts. But I am a person of character, with a heart full of gratitude. I am well aware of the coldness of the world, and how rare are the warm-hearted deeds! I am grateful to everyone who has been kind to me, and I must record every touch of emotion, keeping it forever in my heart, to remind myself, "In days of melancholy, be calm; believe, happy days will come..."
### Make Dreams Come True  
If you speak your wishes out loud, they might not come true! So write them down and hide them in a wish box!

### Bury the Worries  

After more than 20 years of stumbling and bumbling, there are countless embarrassing moments and troubles. I've sincerely found that writing them out and venting a bit can be helpful! So, thank you for burying them in the box of worries!

The world is full of various ups and downs, just live in the present!!!  
If by Life You Were Deceived
Pushkin

If by life you were deceived,  
Don't be dismal, don't be wild!  
In the day of grief, be mild:  
Merry days will come, believe!  

Heart is living in tomorrow;  
Present is dejected here;  
In a moment, passes sorrow;  
That which passes will be dear.
